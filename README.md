## The stack
The React, Webpack, Babel, and Node configuration came from [my own node/react boilerplate.](https://github.com/ClarkGH/react-practice/tree/master/boilerplate)

1. Static NPM server hosting a single static HTML file.
2. React and ReactDOM for javascript/template
3. CSS-in-JS via css-loader
4. Webpack/Babel for cross-browser-compatibility

## The Code

1. /dist contains the bundled javascript/styles and the main html file
2. /server contains the simple node.js server code
3. /src contains the pre-transpiled javascript as well as the CSS styles.
